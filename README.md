# video2morse

## About

Initial code trying to extract morse code from a video. The morse code is assumed to be a flashing lamp (brighter frames = light on, darker frames = light off).

It doesn't handle shifts in brightness throughout the video well. The light needs to be consistent through the video.

It also doesn't handle to much noise well.
